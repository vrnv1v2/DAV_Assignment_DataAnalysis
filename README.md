This repository contains end-to-end analytical and machine learning workflows built to solve seven diverse, real-world data problems. The work spans energy analytics, pollution trend assessment, market segmentation, supervised and unsupervised ML, model validation, and NLP-based spam detection, based on the structured assignment described in the accompanying PPT. Based on this assignment and a subsequent technical interview, I was selected as a Project Lead in the Data Analytics and Visualization Team.
